# A sample implementation of an agent-based model

### Paolo Caressa

This repository contains a script which implements, in a non idiomatic and plain lean-and-mean Python 3 (no Numpy, no Pandas, no Matplotlib etc.), an agent based model for a simple ecological predator-prey system.

It is essentially borrowed from Gary W Flake *The Computational Beauty of the Nature*, where the idea for the set up and the algorithms in their essence are described.

This is not serious research, just a toy but I hope it could be useful to someone.

The simulation happens in a *territory*, thus a 2D grid whose
cells can contain nothing, plants, a herbivore or a carnivore.
    
Each cell is addressed by a pair of coordinates (x,y) that
are integers running as x=0,...,N-1 and y=0,...,M-1.

Two cells are *near* if |x1-x2| <= 1 and |y1-y2| <= 1
    
Three kinds of agents share the territory:

- Plants
- Herbivores
- Carnivores
        
Plants are randomly spread on the territory according to
a certain percentage PLANT_RATIO, and they breed and spread
on the territory, just by contact with empty cells that they
populate (a certain `threshold`, static attribute of the `Plant` class, determines how many plants are needed around an empty spot to let a plant to be born therein).
    
It is assumed that plants
do not die, unless a herbivore eats them, and they are just characterized by occupying a cell
or not.
    
Animals, instead, can die, mate, eat and move, so they
need to be singly represented as agents. Common features
to all animals are:

- (x,y) coordinates of animal position in the territory.
- energy, a number which decreases at each simulation
    cycle and that is increased when the animal eats
    but decreased when the herbivore breeds.
- timespan, the number of expected months of living.
- threshold, the minimum amount of energy needed to breed.
- mating season limits, a lower and upper month of the
    year in which the animal can mate.
    
Herbivores are randomly sparsed on the territory according
to a certain percentage HERBIVORE_RATIO. At each simulation
cycle each herbivore, in random order, can do the following:

    IF its energy or its timespan is <= 0 THEN die.
    ELIF its energy >= its threshold and the month is one of
        the mating season and there is an empty cell near
        the cell occupied by the animal THEN a new animal
        is born in the empty cell. The parent energy
        decreases.
    ELIF there is a plant in a cell near to its cell
        THEN move to that cell, eat the plant and increase
        its energy.
    ELSE try to move on a near cell if empty.

Carnivores are randomly sparsed on the territory according
to a certain percentage CARNIVORE_RATIO. At each simulation
cycle each carnivore, in random order, can do the following:
    
    IF its energy or its timespan is <= 0 THEN die.
    ELIF its energy >= its threshold and the month is one of
        the mating season and there is an empty cell near
        the cell occupied by the animal THEN a new animal
        is born in the empty cell.
    ELIF there is a herbivore in a cell near to its cell
        THEN move to that cell and eat the herbovore, which
        dies.
    ELSE try to move on a near cell if empty or contains
        a plant.

A simulation cycle represents a month.

## Implementation

The code is simple minded, not optimized but hopefully easily understandable and portable.

Since object orientation was invented to program simulations it is worth to use classes.
